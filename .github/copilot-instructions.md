# General Instructions for This Repository

## Core Principles & Code Health
- **Clarity is Key**: Write code that is simple, readable, and self-explanatory.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplicating code. Encapsulate and reuse logic whenever possible.
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data. Load them from environment variables.
- **Remove Dead Code**: Be proactive about deleting commented-out code, unused variables, and unreachable logic. Keep the codebase clean.

---

## Project Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: When new environment variables are needed, also add them to a `.env.example` file with placeholder values. This file should be committed to the repo.
- **Git Ignore**: When adding new tools or frameworks, update the `.gitignore` file with their standard ignore patterns (e.g., add `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`).

---

## Documentation
- **Inline Comments**: For any logic that is complex or non-obvious, add a brief, clear comment explaining the "why," not just the "what."
- **README Updates**: If you add a new feature that requires setup, new environment variables, or a new library, add the necessary documentation to the `README.md` file.

---

## Git Workflow
- **Branch Naming**: When suggesting git commands, name new branches using the `type/short-description` format (e.g., `feat/user-auth`, `fix/api-bug`).
- **Commit Messages**: Follow the Conventional Commits specification. [Image of Conventional Commits examples chart] Start with a type (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`) and link to related issues if applicable.
- **Example Commit**: `feat: add user authentication endpoint (closes #42)`

---

## Naming Conventions
- **General Files**: For non-Python files (like JS, CSS, HTML, or Markdown files), use `kebab-case` for naming (e.g., `user-profile.js`, `main-styles.css`).
